Dear Galfit Users,

I am trying a fit a HST galaxy image. I tried a lot of times and failed each
time. The error log says if the error is repeated a lot of times, emamil to
Chien Peng, however, I thought it would be better to post the question here.

Here is the sim.feedme file:

QUESTION 1:
===========
While fitting devauc profile, I see the parameters total_magnitude and R_e.
From ds9 header I see that:
MAG     =  23.873
RADIUS  =  4.939

Should I fix these two parameters?
#3) 23.873 0 # total magnitude
#4) 4.939 0  # Rs               [Pixels]

One interesting thing is when I open the image in ds9 and look it,
it has y-axis expansion about 9 pixels. Now should I choose R_e >~ 9 pixels and
keep it varialble or I can just keep it fixed to 4.939.

I tried to fix the values and got the numerical error.
I also changed the radius and magnitudes and keep them variable, again failed.


QUESTION 2:
============
The galaxy does not look circular, and seems to be 145 degree rotated.
May be I am fitting wrong profiles. I am fitting devauc and expdisk with above
parameter. It failed and I tried devauc + edgedisk. That also failed.


Error log:
==========
Iteration : 5     Chi2nu: 1.832e+00     dChi2/Chi2: -5.00e+00   alamda: 1e-01
 devauc    : (  300.02,   298.68)   25.17     68.90   [4.00]   0.58    73.86
 edgedisk  : (  299.56,   298.55)  [23.84]   [17.85]   4.22     ---    30.00
COUNTDOWN = 95
Numerical Recipes run-time error...
gaussj: Singular Matrix-1
...now exiting to system...

The error log does not have *something* but again it failed.

Question:
==========
I am fitting a lot of HST images and the galaxies looks different. Shall I try
fitting devauc + expdisk for all of them and wait and see how many gives the
positive results.
What I need is bulge and disk component of all the input galaxies.
How can I do that for all the galaxies.

I have also attached the python code in github to run galfit on different
galaxies.
