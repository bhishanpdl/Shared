How can we fit galaxies using galfit?

1. While fitting galaxy 14, it did not produce any outputs.
2. While fittign galaxy 122, the residual looks very bad, it has tails.

I tried to get bulge and disk profiles of galaxies for long time,
but has been unable to fit the galaxies using galfit.

The help will be greatly appreaciated.
